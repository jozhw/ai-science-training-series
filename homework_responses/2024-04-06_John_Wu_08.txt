What do you think is a particularly good use case for LLMs for science? How would you evaluate it? 

Answer:

LLMs can significantly contribute to the study of cancer genomics, especially when trained on medical sciences literature. 
These models have the capacity to provide valuable recommendations for research directions, aiding in the synthesis of diverse genetic variants associated with specific cancer subtypes. 
By piecing together these variants, researchers can identify potential solutions or cures tailored to individual cancer types, thus advancing precision medicine approaches in oncology.

To evalulate the success of the LLM for this use case, the recommendations that are selected to go through the rigorous
processes of experimentation will be peer reviewed to confirm the validity of the recommendations.
